RASPA3 is a molecular simulation code for computing adsorption and 
diffusion in nanoporous materials, and thermodynamic and transport 
properties of fluids. It implements force field based classical 
Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics in various ensembles. RASPA3 can be 
used for the simulation of molecules in gases, fluids, zeolites, 
aluminosilicates, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nanotubes.

One of the main applications of RASPA3 is to compute adsorption 
isotherms and to understand the atomic-level mechanism of adsorption 
and separations.
